        <h1>Privacy Awareness</h1>

        <p>This webpage is designed to teach you all about privacy awareness online, both when surfing the web and also when using apps on your phone.
            <br>Click on the navigation bar on top of the page to learn more about the different subjects.</p>

        <h2>Why is it important to know about online privacy?</h2>
        <p> There are many reasons why it is important to know how privacy rules and regulations work.
            <br>The most important one is so you are aware of the information you leave when you visit a website or download an app.
            <br>Who gets your information when you click on a link or a webpage, and what can this information be used for? </p>
        <p> Is it truly possible to stay anonymous and private in today’s digital environment? The current laws and regulations around privacy are few and limited, but this does not seem to affect online viewers’ behavior and willingness to expose their private
            lives and preferences. Social media poses a paradox for privacy. We share personal information widely — posting pictures, sharing our location, and even disclosing our preferences by way of “likes” or emojis. The social feedback, accessibility,
            and the ability to enhance social communication and interpersonal relationships is part of why social media is so attractive to users, but these features also pose a threat to users’ privacy.
        </p>
        <p>According to the Pew Research Center, more than two-thirds of American adults used social networking sites as of 2018, more than nine times the number of Americans using social networking sites in 2005. Numbers from Statista.com show Facebook
            alone reported more than 2.7 billion monthly active users as of the second quarter of 2020. In recent years, many users have voiced concern about their online privacy, but that does not seem to halt people’s use of social media platforms.
            Social media has blurred the line between what is public and what is private information.
