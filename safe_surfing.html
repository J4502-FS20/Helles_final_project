        <h1>Privacy Awareness</h1>
        <h2>Safe surfing</h2>
        <p>
            On this page you will find simple tips and tricks to protect your online privacy, both on your laptop and your phone. According to a Microsoft Security Intelligence report, 16 million households have experienced a serious virus problem in the last two
            years. What’s the estimated cost to families impacted by viruses, spyware, and phishing? $4.55 billion! The costs of viruses and other online cyber threats can add up fast:

            <li>Cost of virus removal</li>
            <li>Lost productivity while computer is down</li>
            <li>Compromised bank or credit card information</li>
            <li>Repairs for computer systems that are damaged</li>
            <li>Replacement of damaged devices or routers</li>
            <li>Avoid all that by adopting these good internet habits</li>
        </p>

        <h4>1. Install a Trusted Antivirus Software</h4>
        <p>
            Antivirus software can stop internet-based threats and warn you of dangerous websites. They’re your first line of defense against virus removal. Be sure to keep your antivirus updated and make sure everyone’s computer in your household uses one.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Be Careful What You Download, Including Apps</h4>
        <p>
            You do a quick search on free photo software, and just assume something in the first few search results must be a safe site, right? Wrong. Never download software or apps from sites or vendors you don’t know or haven’t researched. Just one click can open
            your desktop or mobile device to a hacker.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Look for the HTTPS</h4>
        <p>
            That little bit of text before the “www” means a lot. If a site has just “http” that means it’s not secure. The “https” has a padlock in the URL field and indicates that the website is secure and uses encryption to scramble any data you share. This is
            especially a must for any site you shop with and share your credit card details on.
        </p>

        <h4>4. Think Before You Click that Email Link</h4>
        <p>
            Phishing emails are the top delivery method for viruses and malware. They’re designed to look like a legitimate email from businesses you might know, but when you click the link, you’re taken to a site that can download a virus on your computer. Learn
            to hover over email links without clicking. That can reveal that the real URL looks nothing like the legitimate site you thought it was and save you from a big click mistake.
        </p>

        <h4>5. Get a Good Password Manager</h4>
        <p>Hackers know the top passwords that people use and can easily get past them to gain entry into your system. Use a password manager to generate and save complex passwords that are much harder to get past.</p>

        <h4>6. Turn off Location Services on Mobile Devices</h4>
        <p>
            It’s fun to share photos online, but strangers don’t really need a mapped location to the dog park near your house. Turn off location services on your mobile devices to ensure you’re not giving away more information about you and your family than you
            want to.
