        <h1>Privacy Awareness</h1>
        <h2>Check your privacy</h2>
        <p> The Internet is very convenient and useful, but using it has made our personal data more vulnerable. Many companies, large and small, either discreetly or openly collect information about us to use or sell. The easiest way for them to use this
            data is to show us an ad that we are likely to click on.
            <br>No one worried about this during the early stages of the Internetâ€™s development. But today, taking steps to protect your personal data is gradually becoming the same type of social norm as brushing your teeth. However, if you forgot to brush
            your teeth yesterday, you can still brush them today. If your personal data was leaked yesterday, there is nothing you can do about it today.
