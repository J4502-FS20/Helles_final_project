        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <br>
        <h4>-What is a Privacy Policy?</h4>
        <p>A Privacy Policy is a legal agreement designed to let visitors to your website or users of your app know what personal information you gather about them, how you use this information and how you keep it safe. A Privacy Policy for a website or
            app generally covers:
            <li>-The types of information collected by the website or app
                <li>-The purpose of this data collection
                    <li>-Data storage, security and access
                        <li>-Details of data transfers
                            <li>-Affiliated websites or organizations
                                <li>-Cookies</p>

        <h4>-Who are the best companies at maintaining personal information?</h4>
        <p>The best businesses are businesses that do not collect the information in the first place. Small businesses are good at not collecting information. A good second choice is a businesses that is designed specifically to keep your information private.
            Our business falls into this second category. Some businesses' privacy practices are regulated by the government. Hospitals and doctors are currently monitored so they do a great job.

            <li>Cash businesses
                <li>Hospitals
                    <li>Doctors
                        <li>Many very small businesses</p>
        <h4>-What is the worst thing that can happen?</h4>
        <p>While identity theft is a possibility, it is usually conducted by individuals in your area, not by companies you do business with. Violations of your personal information are more likely to included excessive e-mail, excessive physical mail, and
            wasted time organizing and deleting this junk on a daily basis. In our case, the e-mail addresses for customer service on our websites get over 1,000 unsolicited and wasteful e-mails each day. Finding the 20-30 legitimate e-mails every day
            is a major chore. While we may be unusual in our problem, we are probably just an indicator of what will happen to others in the not-distant future. If everyone in the US had to filter through 1,000 e-mails each day, e-mail would no longer
            be a useful form of communication. The loss in productivity would be significant.</p>
        <h4>-Who collects all of this personal information?</h4>
        <p>It used to be that companies kept a list or file of their customers for their own use. In fact, while the catalog business began in the 1870's the business of brokering mailing lists didn't begin until the 1960's. Acxiom, the largest publicly
            traded list broker began in 1969 and took in $700M last year. The CEO of Acxiom earned $4,587,000 last year in salary and stock options. These days, typical costs for a customer list is 3.6 cents per name. Two things are striking about this.
            The first is that companies will sell us out for much less than 3.6 pennies, the second is that Acxiom had to sell over 120,000,000 mailing addresses just to pay their CEO. That represents half of the household in the United States.</p>
        <h4>-What can be done to prevent this?</h4>
        <p>Regulation seems unlikely to solve some of the problems (especially spam) but it could make a significant impact. Regulation recently made a large difference in homes that have become listed on the do not call registry here in the US. Regulation
            would likely reduce the amount of e-mail we get from US companies, but would that even be 10% of the unsolicited e-mail we currently receive? Careful sharing is important. It keeps your information in the hands of people that won't share or
            use it. Sometimes this is not possible. One example is my company's e-mail addresses. We have to share our information so that our customers can reach us. Unfortunately, by posting our e-mail address on our websites we receive buckets of unsolicited
            e-mail. Spam filters can be effective, but rarely do they catch everything and often they remove valuable e-mails from your inbox. Either way, it is difficult and time consuming to administer these methods.</p>
